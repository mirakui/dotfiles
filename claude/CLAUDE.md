# Development Rules
- Please practice t_wada style Test Driven Development. Before starting implementation, please write a failing test first to express the expected change. Then, implement so that the test passes.
- At each step, please hand over the work after ensuring that test, lint, formatter, and build pass.
- Deleting files is prohibited. Move unnecessary files into a directory named .cctmp/trash/ in the project's root directory.
- Place scripts necessary for debugging and behavior verification into a directory named .cctmp/scratch/ in the project's root directory.
- Place the results of any investigation or code review tasks requested by me into a directory named .cctmp/docs/ in the project's root directory, in markdown format.
- When starting to work on a task requested by me, please ask me several questions first to resolve any ambiguities before proceeding with the work.

# Git Operations
- Please write git commit messages in the Conventional Commits format.
- When performing a git commit, please list the prompts I have given you so far verbatim in the commit message.
- Please write git commit messages in English. If the prompt's instructions were in Japanese, please include the original Japanese prompt as is.

Please read the above rules and then start development.
