# Development Rules

- Practice Test Driven Development in the t_wada style. Before starting the implementation, first write a failing test that expresses the expected change. Afterward, implement the code to make that test pass.
- Ensure that the tests, lint, formatter, and build pass before handing over the work.
- Place scripts required for debugging or operational verification in a directory named `.cctmp/scratch/` created in the project root directory.
- When starting the task I requested, please begin by analyzing the code, and if there are any points of clarification, use the AskUserQuestion tool to ask me.

# Git Operations

- Write git commit comments in the Conventional Commits format.
- When committing to git, list all the prompts instructed up to that point in their original text within the commit comment.
- Write git commit comments in English. If the prompt instructions were in Japanese, include the original text of the prompt in Japanese.

Please recite these rules aloud to confirm your understanding before starting development.
