# Development Rules

- Practice Test Driven Development in the t_wada style. Before starting the implementation, first write a failing test that expresses the expected change. Afterward, implement the code to make that test pass.
- Ensure that the tests, lint, formatter, and build pass before handing over the work.
- Deleting files is prohibited. Move unnecessary files to a directory named `.cctmp/trash/` created in the project root directory.
- Place scripts required for debugging or operational verification in a directory named `.cctmp/scratch/` created in the project root directory.
- For research tasks or code review results requested by me, place them in Markdown format within a directory named `.cctmp/docs/` created in the project root directory.
- When starting a task requested by me, please ask me several questions first to resolve any ambiguities before proceeding with the work.

# Git Operations

- Write git commit comments in the Conventional Commits format.
- When committing to git, list all the prompts instructed up to that point in their original text within the commit comment.
- Write git commit comments in English. If the prompt instructions were in Japanese, include the original text of the prompt in Japanese.

Please recite these rules aloud to confirm your understanding before starting development.
